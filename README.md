My name's Ethan. I'm a PhD student at the University of Glasgow (Scotland) and my main research interests are games and spreading processes on graphs and combinatorial differential equations. I also help to teach a number of courses in Computing Science at Glasgow.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on code that runs an agency-based model of infectious disease [here](https://github.com/ethankelly/Agency)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on work related to infectious disease modelling, computationally and/or mathematically.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with representing a recursive method graphically, perhaps as a flow chart.
